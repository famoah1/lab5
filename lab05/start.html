        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Martin Luther King Jr. was born on January 15, 1929, in Atlanta, Georgia, as the second child of pastor Martin Luther King Sr. and former schoolteacher Alberta Williams King.King attended segregated public schools. and was admitted to Morehouse College at the age of 15.After that, King enrolled in a graduate program at Boston University, where he completed his courses in 1953 and earned a doctorate in systematic theology two years later. He met Coretta Scott, a teenage soprano from Alabama who was studying at the New England Conservatory of Music, while in Boston. In 1953, the pair married and moved to Montgomery, Alabama, where King became pastor of the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church.</p>
        <p>As their father had directed, King and his two siblings would read aloud the Bible at their childhood home. After dinners there, King's grandmother Jennie, whom he affectionately called "Mama," would tell her grandkids vivid Bible stories. King's father would often employ whippings to punish his children.King Sr. would occasionally whip his children.King's father subsequently noted, "[King] was the most peculiar child whenever you whipped him." He'd stand there, tears falling down his cheeks, and he'd never weep."</p>
        <p>King saw his father fight against segregation and other types of injustice. When halted by a police officer who called King Sr. a "boy" King's father retorted angrily that King was a boy but a man. When King's father took him into a shoe store in downtown Atlanta, the clerk directed them to the rear. Before removing King and leaving the store, King's father resisted, saying, <strong>"We'll either buy shoes sitting here or we won't buy any shoes at all. I don't care how long I have to live with this system,"</strong> he later told King, <em>"I will never accept it."</em></p>

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>The King family had been in Montgomery for less than a year when the city became the hub of America's expanding civil rights battle, powered by the famous Brown v. Board of Education decision in 1954.In March 1955, Claudette Colvin, a fifteen-year-old black student in Montgomery, refused to give up her bus seat to a white man in defiance of Jim Crow laws, which imposed racial segregation in the Southern United States. King served on the Birmingham African-American community's investigation committee; E. D. Nixon and Clifford Durr agreed to wait for a better case to pursue because the event involved a kid.</p>
        <p>Rosa Parks, secretary of the local chapter of the <strong>National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP)</strong>, was jailed on December 1, 1955, for refusing to give up her seat on a Montgomery bus to a white passenger. Activists organized a bus boycott that would last 381 days. The Montgomery Bus Boycott put a significant financial pressure on the public transportation system and downtown business owners. Martin Luther King Jr. was chosen as the protest's leader and official spokesman.By the time the Supreme Court determined that segregated sitting on public buses was unconstitutional in November 1956, King had emerged as an inspirational proponent of organized, peaceful opposition, largely influenced by Mahatma Gandhi and activist Bayard Rustin.White supremacists had also targeted King, who had his family's home firebombed in January.</p>
        <p>During this campaign, King was arrested for driving 30 mph in a 25 mph zone , which drew the attention of national media overnight and considerably elevated King's public image. The controversy concluded when the United States District Court in Browder v. Gayle delivered a judgement prohibiting racial segregation on all Montgomery public buses. Blacks were able to re-board buses and sit in the front with full legal authorization.King's engagement in the bus boycott elevated him to national prominence and made him the most well-known civil rights leader.</p>

        <h2>Impact</h2>
        <img class="pic"src="Martin_Luther King 2.jpg" alt="Martin Luther King"> <figcaption class="caption"> MLK the Leader</figcaption>
        <p>Dr. King, a leader for all people, never chose fear over courage and determination when fighting for civil rights in the face of injustice, ignorance, and violence. He refused to let prison, assault, or the possibility of death influence his final objective. Instead, he stood by his goal of obtaining universal human rights through nonviolent protests.</p>
        <p>Dr. King envisioned a more varied America in which everyone could experience the benefits of <strong>equality</strong>. During a time when the opposition was enacting legislation that denied people of color their rights and expressing hatred through beatings and killings, Dr. King continued to choose the high road.He recognized that violence would play into the opposition's plan. He was well aware that violent vengeance would precisely fit the stereotype that many had constructed of civil rights militants. As a result, he was continually preaching that nonviolence would eventually allow the opposition to win.</p>
        <p>Dr. King also recognized the need of uniting the masses in pursuit of a single purpose. Separately, making any major progress would be difficult. Collectively, he and other civil rights advocates could influence laws and change across the country. Dr. King's leadership aided the overall success of the civil rights movement in the mid-1900s and continues to have an impact on <em>civil rights movements today</em>.</p>

        <h2>Key Moments of Martin Luther King:</h2>
        <h3>Gifted at a young age:</h3>
        <p>King skipped two grades and entered college at the age of 15. He was admitted to Morehouse College in 1944 and graduated in 1948 with a B.A. in Sociology at the age of 19. The Morehouse president, Dr. Benjamin E. Mays, became an inspirational figure in King’s life.</p>
        <h3>Surviving an assassination:</h3>
        <p>On September 20, 1958, King was attending a book signing at a Blumstein's department store in Harlem when a young woman approached him. Izola Ware Curry, the woman, inquired whether he was Martin Luther King Jr., and when he said yes, she thrust a seven-inch letter opener into his chest. Curry claimed she had been looking for him for five years, assuming he had Communist Party affiliations.</p>
        <h3>The truth about his death:</h3>
        <p>Overwhelming evidence showed James Earl Ray was not the shooter but was set up to take the blame. After the evidence showed Ray did not pull the trigger, local, state and federal U.S government agencies, and the Mafia were to blame.The King family was awarded $100, which they donated to charity. To them, it was never about the money; they just wanted the truth out, and for justice to be served.</p>

        <p>"<em>In a sense we've come to our nation's capital to cash a check. When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, they were signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir. This note was a promise that all men – yes, black men as well as white men – would be guaranteed the unalienable rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.… America has given the Negro people a bad check, a check which has come back marked 'insufficient funds.'"--Martin Luther King Jr </em> </p>
